# DeepQLearning
small experiments with agents learning atari games, implemented in jax/numpy


mostly following the 2013 NeurIPS paper [Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning
](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602) by Mnih et al.

### Other Links

- experimental code setup partly based on this [pytorch implementation](https://github.com/philtabor/Youtube-Code-Repository/tree/master/ReinforcementLearning/DeepQLearning)
- nice explanation on the [preprocessing with frame skipping](https://danieltakeshi.github.io/2016/11/25/frame-skipping-and-preprocessing-for-deep-q-networks-on-atari-2600-games/)


This is a WIP
